## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-18

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES ⚠️

- Migrated project from `Javascript` to `Typescript`. **(Note**: This change is not backward compatible.)
    - Supported declaration files:
        - `ESM`
        - `CommonJS`
        - `UMD`
        - `Typescript`

### 🚀 Features

- Added a dedicated interface extending the global Window type to safely expose Scrollspy without overwriting existing
  globals used by extensions or the demo playground.
- Introduced shared helper utilities to improve code reuse, readability, and long-term maintainability across the
  codebase.
- Package was migrated to `TypeScript`, improving type safety, tooling support, and maintainability.

### 🔧 Changes

- Refactored tests to use `Bun test` instead of `Jest`
- Improved keywords declared in the `package.json` files.

        - Built-in environment variable support (`.env` files)
        - Native TypeScript compilation
        - Better CSS/asset handling for future scalability

    - Removed `rollup.config.js` (replaced by `vite.config.js`)
    - Removed build helper script `scripts/build-demo.mjs` (Vite handles env vars natively)

### 📝 Documentation

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-20

### 🚀 Added

- **Zero dependencies** — lightweight, pure vanilla JS with ES6+ support.
- **Dynamic navigation detection** — automatically maps navigation anchors to content sections.
- **Customizable selector support** — configure navigation and content selectors (`nav`, `content`).
- **Nested navigation support** — highlight parent navigation items with `nested` and `nestedClass` options.
- **Offset support** — adjust scroll position offsets for fixed headers or UI elements.
- **Bottom detection** — intelligently detects when the last section is active based on scroll position and the distance
  from the bottom of the page (`bottomThreshold`).
- **Reflow on resize** — optionally recalculates positions on window resize (`reflow`).
- **Observe DOM mutations** — automatically refreshes navigation targets when content changes (`observe`).
- **Smooth scroll tracking** — updates active navigation items as you scroll with requestAnimationFrame debouncing.
- **Manual control methods** — `setup()`, `refresh()`, `detect()`, and `destroy()` for fine control.
- **Custom events** — emits `gumshoeactivate` events on active section changes for integration.
- **Performance-optimized** — caches lookups with a `Map` for quick DOM access.
- **Intelligent bottom detection** — adjusts behavior near the bottom of the page to ensure last section activation.
- **Flexible activation logic** — supports multiple active sections and custom offset calculation.
- **Clean API** — class-based usage with simple initialization and teardown.
- **SPA support** — works seamlessly with single-page applications (SPA) and dynamic content using the
  `fragmentAttribute` option.

### 🛠 Changed

- Debounced `scroll` and `resize` handlers using `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Improved internal caching via `Map` for faster DOM lookup.
- Scroll tracking logic improved for edge cases (e.g. last item not being activated).
- Internal method names and structure are reorganized for clarity.
- Support for both hash and full URLs in `href` for navigation anchors.
- Defensive checks in `getContents` to avoid errors with missing fragments or targets.
- `fragmentAttribute` now accepts a function for advanced mapping scenarios.
- Added `destroyListeners` method for proper cleanup of scroll/resize listeners.
- Added `navItemSelector` option to customize which anchors are considered navigation items.
- Improved documentation for SPA/Angular scenarios and advanced usage in README.
